#Brief Description of EAD feature to be implemented: 
We have opted to implement the Security Enterprise Feature. We are implementing a token based login and register functionality which is highly secure when compared to that of traditional login functionality. 
Token-based authentication is different from traditional password-based or server-based authentication techniques. Tokens offer a second layer of security, and administrators have detailed control over each action and transaction.
Token Based Authentication describes our mode of authentication.

#Problems
We are using redux module for state management and the issue is that while we are reloading the page the state is becoming null. We believe that this is caused as the data is not stored in the local storage of the browser. We would like to know the views of external faculty on this.
